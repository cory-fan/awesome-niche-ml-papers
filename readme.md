Papers that I have actually found useful in practical network design.

This is for personal use but making it public for the potential that someone enjoys these papers as much as I did.

***General***

**Deep Learning is Not So Strange Or Mysterious (ICML Position Papers 2025)**

Covers general ideas of overparameterized deep learning.

**DeepMAD: Mathematical Architecture Design for Deep Convolutional Neural Network**

Pretty interesting introduction to zero-shot NAS. Designing CNNs, but not quite CNN specific.

***Point Clouds***

**Decoupled Local Aggregation (2023) & DeLAv2 (2025)**

Practical approach to very efficient max-pooled point cloud networks.

***Image Reconstruction***

**X-Restormer: A Comparative Study of Image Restoration Networks for General Backbone Network Design (ECCV 2024)**

Discusses task differences between various image restoration approaches.
